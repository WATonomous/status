# WATcloud Status Page

The [WATcloud Status Page](https://status.watonomous.ca) is a frontend-only web app that pulls data from various sources like [Healthchecks.io](https://healthchecks.io)
and [Sentry](https://sentry.io) to provide a single place to view the health of WATcloud.

## Development

To run the status page locally, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
Then, you can run the following commands to install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
